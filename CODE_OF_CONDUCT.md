# Our Code of conduct
May , 2025.

Supporting a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone in our community is paramount, as is strengthening connections with other communities that have influenced our work. Our Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct).


We commit to providing a safe, respectful, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

We try to cultivate a tone where everyone in the community, no matter their backgrounds and accomplishments, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. Questions are always welcome and always appropriate because they expose opportunities for clarification and challenge implicit assumptions. 

In order for us to do our best science, we must:

# Be Respectful

We value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but we can do so with grace and good manners.  We are open to being wrong. We are respectful in all interactions and communications.  We are constructive, collaborative,  and positive. We take responsibility for our impact and our mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through our words or actions, we listen carefully,  apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.

# Be Direct 

The scientific process demands that we speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. Doing this respectfully is hard and hearing such comments as the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.

# Be respectful

Seek varied perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.

We will be respectful of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:

1.    Remote (on video or phone)
1.    Not native language speakers
1.    Coming from a different culture
1.    Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”
1.    Living in a different time zone
1.    Facing other challenges to participate

Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate.  Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.

# Appreciate and Accommodate Our Differences

We come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others' needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.


# Summary

Be respectful, direct, accommodating, appreciative, and open to learning from everyone else.

Do not attack, demean, disrupt, harass, or threaten others or encourage such behavior.

This Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in this project. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, remote calls, and in person.


# Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting Min-Yang Lee at Min-Yang.Lee@noaa.gov or Tammy.Murphy@noaa.gov with a description of what has occurred and any supporting information that would be helpful. After receiving a concise description of your situation, Min-Yang or Tammy will review the report and determine next steps. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
