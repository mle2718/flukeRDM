 Script:       catch_per_trip_projection_part2.do
 Purpose:      Builds the projection-year catch draw files the R projection
               stage consumes. Takes the calendar of days that had directed
               trips, expands each day x mode into 50 simulated trips with 30
               catch-per-trip draws each, and attaches a catch outcome to
               every one of those rows by sampling from the copula-generated
               pool of outcomes for the matching mode x wave stratum. The
               result is one file per state x draw giving simulated catch for
               every trip on every fishing day.

 Structure:    The per-state x per-draw loop is the calibration script's
               loop minus the cost, preference-parameter and demographics
               resamples. The shared blocks are the programs
               sf_load_directed_trips, sf_expand_trips_and_ids and
               sf_sample_catch_by_mode_wave in catch_per_trip_programs.do;
               this file is the loop that calls them plus the
               projection-specific tail (rename the species totals, keep the
               projection columns, add date_num, save). See the program
               headers for the behaviour marked PRESERVED.
 Inputs:       directed_trips_calibration_<ST>.csv (from
               directed_trips_calibration.do),
               proj_catch_draws_raw_<ST>_<i>.dta (from
               copula_modeling_projection.R)
 Outputs:      proj_catch_draws_<ST>_<i>.dta
 Dependencies: Globals $misc_data_cd, $proj_catch_data_cd, $input_code_cd and
               $ndraws. Programs from catch_per_trip_programs.do (done
               below). Uses the user-written commands distinct and renvarlab.
 Pipeline:     Step 9c of model_wrapper.do, inside the catch_per_trip_project
               meta-toggle that runs part1, the R copula step, this script and
               compare_projection_data_to_MRIP.do as one unit. The calibration
               analog of this script is
               calibration_catch_per_trip_part2.do.

 Sizing note: the 50 trips x 30 catch draws per day x mode is the source of
               this stage's runtime and disk footprint - a state with ~200
               fishing days across three modes produces on the order of a
               million rows per draw, and that is repeated $ndraws times.
