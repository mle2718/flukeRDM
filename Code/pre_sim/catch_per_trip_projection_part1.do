 Script:       catch_per_trip_projection_part1.do
 Purpose:      Projection-period analog of
               catch_per_trip_calibration_part1.do. Estimates mean
               harvest-, discard- and catch-per-trip with standard errors by
               state x wave x mode, imputing standard errors for strata that
               contain only a single MRIP primary sampling unit, and writes
               the per-stratum file the projection copula step draws from.

               The one substantive difference from the calibration version is
               the sample window: the calibration uses a single fishing year;
               this uses the rolling window of recent MRIP waves defined by
               $projection_catch_per_trip_years in model_wrapper.do, because
               the projection is made before the current year is complete.
               That global must be revised after each MRIP data release.
               There is no Part B (no MRIP totals) in the projection.

 Structure:    Part A is the program sf_build_cpt_strata in
               catch_per_trip_programs.do, shared with the calibration
               script; this file is one call to it.
 Inputs:       The MRIP trip and catch files named by $triplist and $catchlist.
 Outputs:      $misc_data_cd\projected_mrip_catch_processed.xlsx (the
               per-stratum mean and standard-error file consumed by
               copula_modeling_projection.R).
 Dependencies: Globals $triplist, $catchlist, $misc_data_cd, $input_code_cd
               and $projection_catch_per_trip_years. Requires MRIP_lists.do
               to have run. Programs from catch_per_trip_programs.do (done
               below). Uses the user-written command dsconcat.
 Pipeline:     Step 9a of model_wrapper.do, inside the catch_per_trip_project
               meta-toggle that runs this, the R copula step, part2 and the
               MRIP comparison as one unit.
