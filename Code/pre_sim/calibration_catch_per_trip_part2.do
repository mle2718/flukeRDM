/*******************************************************************************
 Script:       calibration_catch_per_trip_part2.do
 Purpose:      Two jobs. First, builds the angler demographic pool (age and
               avidity) from the MRIP Fishing Effort Survey 12-month files,
               with the QA/QC screens the FES delivery notes require. Second,
               builds the calibration-year catch draw files: for every day
               with directed trips, 50 simulated trips x 30 catch-per-trip
               draws, each assigned a trip cost sampled by mode, a set of
               angler preference parameters, demographics sampled by wave
               from the pool built in the first half, and a catch outcome
               sampled from the copula pool for its mode x wave stratum.

 Structure:    The calendar load, the 50 x 30 expansion with its mode_id /
               wave_id keys, and the catch-sampling loop are shared with the
               projection script as the programs sf_load_directed_trips,
               sf_expand_trips_and_ids and sf_sample_catch_by_mode_wave in
               catch_per_trip_programs.do. The with-replacement sampling
               idiom used four times below is sample_with_replacement, and
               the state-label block of Section A is sf_label_states (shared
               with part1). The cost, preference-parameter and demographics
               resamples exist only here and stay inline. See the program
               headers for the behaviour marked PRESERVED.
 Inputs:       fes_person_final_2023<wave>.dta (waves 1-6),
               directed_trips_calibration_<ST>.csv (from
               directed_trips_calibration.do),
               calib_catch_draws_raw_<ST>_<i>.dta (from
               copula_modeling_calibration.R),
               trip_costs.dta,
               preference_params.dta
 Outputs:      angler_dems.dta, calib_catch_draws_<ST>_<i>.dta
 Dependencies: Globals $misc_data_cd, $calib_catch_data_cd, $input_code_cd
               and $ndraws. Programs from catch_per_trip_programs.do (done
               below). Uses the user-written commands dsconcat, distinct and
               renvarlab.
 Pipeline:     Step 5c of model_wrapper.do, gated by the `catch_per_trip2'
               toggle (default ON). Its projection-year analog is
               catch_per_trip_projection_part2.do, which shares
               the trip expansion and catch-sampling programs but attaches
               no costs, preferences or demographics.

 Data sensitivity note: the FES 12-month files read below are NOT publicly
 available and, per the note from the data provider reproduced in the source
 comments, are essentially unedited raw responses. The QA/QC screens applied
 here are this project's own, not NOAA's - the 12-month effort fields do not
 go through the editing that the 2-month fields do.

 Demographics: age and avidity (number trips past 12 months).
 Ages and avidity come from the fishing effort survey 12 MONTH files.
 These data are NOT publicly available and the data have not been processed
 for QA/QC like the publicly available 2-month files.
 Data from 2018-2023 was delivered by Lucas Johanssen on 4/23/2025. A few
 notes/caveats from Lucas:
   "FES QC processes focus on the 2-month reference periods, and we do very
   little evaluation and editing of 12-month effort responses.
   Responses for these fields are essentially unedited, raw data.
   The final weight trimming procedures focus on reducing the impacts of
   outlier values on wave-level estimates.
   The data may include records that are highly influential with respect to
   12-month effort and any estimates may be highly variable.
   Wave data will produce independent estimates of 12-month effort."
 The most recent year of FES survey data available (2023) is used.

 the choice experiment's sampling frame (licensees), so that the simulated
 age distribution and the estimated preferences describe the same
 population. Reporting more trips in the last 2 months than in the last 12

 365 twelve-month trips is more than one per day, both taken as

 For every state and draw: expand the calendar of days with directed trips

 a trip cost (resampled by mode), preference parameters (resampled per

 outcome (sampled from the copula pool by mode x wave). The order matters:
 every resample consumes the random number stream, and every sort and
